# Personal Portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio that I have created using the knowledge I have gained for the past 2 months. It will showcase my skills that I have learnt such as HTML and CSS. This portfolio is also for recruiters to consider hiring me and in hopes that I have presented myself in best light.



# Design Process
My process when it comes to designing the website is firstly, how would I as a user would enjoy looking at the website and secondly, how easy it will be to navigate. Initially I had problems designing my website as I was not sure how I wanted my website to look like if it is in a mobile view. I had to do intensive research on how i wanted my website to look like so i had to go on to sites like Pinterest to look for inspiration.
This website is also focusing on recruiters looking to recruit fresh graduates and i believe my website is the best way to achieve that as it is user friendly and has a minimalistic look which i think recruiters might appreciate.

As a user, i want to be able to find out relevant information that could lead me to hiring someone. It has to be easy to navigate, and also have contact information or contact form that is readily available

# Technologies Used
For the website, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
I had to use HTML because templates were not allowed so I had to code the website from the beginning.

CSS
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
I had to use CSS so that I am able to style my website to my specific needs.

JavaScript
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
I had to use JavaScript for input validation for my contact form.

Extra information:
On home page click "Muhammad"
Goes to my personal "LinkedIn" page



Contact form:
On home page click "Contact Me!" OR Click contact icon on navigation bar.
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

One problem I faced was trying to make input validation work for my contact form - email field. I was confused as to why it did not work so I had to refer to external materials on youtube to guide me the proper way for input validation.
